# flask-to-do-list

app was deployed on heroku when it was free :)

now to run it You need to create python virtual environment:

    $ python -m venv venv
    
then activate environment and install packages:

    (venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
and simply type `flask run`. Then You can open App in your browser using given loopback IP address.

App contains login logic and lets its users create several to-do lists with elements that can be checked as done (I know, very impressive...)
